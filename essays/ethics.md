## Cogs: Contributing Members of Society

One of the greatest needs of society as a whole are the services provided or works produced by professionals like doctors, lawyers and scientists, to name a few.  This is not to say that non-professional workers do not contribute in with positive impact or are insignificant in terms of the work they do.  Professionals and other workers generally do something to improve or maintain the well-being of some aspect within our society.  We expect doctors to save lives, so theyâ€™re important, but even workers with less-respected regards like humble farmers are important too because they produce the food that all people need to survive.  In order for the results of any contributing member of society to have a meaningful and positive effect on improving or maintaining the welfare of society, the things they do should generally be done or made with respect to what is ethical.  Software engineers are professional contributing members of society too, so they are no exception to this principle.


## Ethical Practices as Teeth

We can think of all working individuals, including software engineers, as cogs that are necessary for society to function or proceed.  Each cog has teeth, and every tooth is needed to allow another cog to progress.  Among those teeth is the principle of ethics and ethical practice.  We can't have healthy people with doctors that perform malpractice.  Similarly, we expect that banks that withhold and protect our monetary properties do so without fail.  The common factor in this formula is idea of working ethically, in ways that are within the public's interest, have a positive effect on society or the well-being of humans, while also not causing harm.  For software engineers, this means they are expected to code works with honesty and integrity.  The bits of data that reflect how much money we have in the bank should not have some way of being compromised, whether intentional or not.  With how integral software is in many vectors of society today, software engineers actually have a considerable amount of impact.

## ["The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of"](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

One developer gave reconsideration and felt remorse when he realized that the code he produced as part of his job may not only cause harm, but did so in less than honest ways.  He was asked to program a quiz that essentially pushed a particular drug to patients regardless of the various answers they provided, unless certain allergies were specified.  This developer felt guilty for being a part of this upon discovering that a person taking the drug promoted by his development had committed suicide because of the drug's side effects.  Ironically, he learned that his sister was also prescribed the same drug, so he advised against taking it.  As a result of this experience and involvement, this developer is now more mindful about the work he creates.

If I were in the shoes of this developer, I would not stop at questioning my superior about the functionality of the quiz, which again, was to push a particular drug.  This alone is suspicious and deceitful, which is unethical.  This incident also highlights the importance of examining the purpose of what we are aiming to promote or achieve.  While it is important to do as one is told to get the job done in order to get paid and make ends meet, we should not proceed if it's at the expense of the safety and well-being of others.

*"As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices."*

It is important that we, as software developers, think about the well-being of others and society as a whole as we write code. Innocent people can be wronged by the money-hungry drive that will never cease to exist in businesses and may or may not always be honest and ethical.  Software developers can provide positive contributions and protect society by avoiding being a part of potentially harmful productions.
