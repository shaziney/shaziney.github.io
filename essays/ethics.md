## Cogs: Contributing Members of Society

One of the greatest needs of society as a whole are the services provided or works produced by professionals like doctors, lawyers and scientists, to name a few.  This is not to say that non-professional workers do not contribute in with positive impact or are insignificant in terms of the work they do.  Professionals and other workers generally do something to improve or maintain the well-being of some aspect within our society.  We expect doctors to save lives, so theyâ€™re important, but even workers with less-respected regards like humble farmers are important too because they produce the food that all people need to survive.  In order for the results of any contributing member of society to have a meaningful and positive effect on improving or maintaining the welfare of society, the things they do should generally be done or made with respect to what is ethical.  Software engineers are professional contributing members of society too, so they are no exception to this principle.


## Ethical Practices as Teeth

We can think of all working individuals, including software engineers, as cogs that are necessary for society to function or proceed.  Each cog has teeth, and every tooth is needed to allow another cog to progress.  Among those teeth is the principle of ethics and ethical practice.  We can't have healthy people with doctors that perform malpractice.  Similarly, we expect that banks that withhold and protect our monetary properties do so without fail.  The common factor in this formula is idea of working ethically, in ways that are consistent with the public interest or contribute to society and human well-being.
