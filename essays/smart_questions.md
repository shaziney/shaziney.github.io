Why smart questions are important for smart software engineers?
How the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions.
How the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

## Learning From Others

No human being can stand to develop, improve, and solve all problems solely on their own. Instead, we often require further insight and knowledge from other people in order to become more learned in any subject and find solutions to various problems.  This idea is especially true for software engineers or programmers, and it is not limited to those whose programming skills are elementary at best.  At some point and time, a software engineer may have trouble with trying to find a bug or resolve a problem in his or her software, or a student aspiring to be a software engineer may not quite understand how to properly apply a certain method to his or her code.  In any case, an individual who is met with similar circumstances should seek help from others.  One of the most valuable skills one can have, as a simple human and a software engineer, is the ability to ask ‘smart questions’.

## Asking ‘Smart Questions’

“You reap what you sow” could not be a more fitting expression to describe why it is important for a software engineer or programmer to ask a ‘smart question’.  Simply put, a well-developed question is more likely to receive a well-developed or satisfying answer.  This holds true in technical forums like Stack Overflow, which is a great place to ask questions and find answers related to programming.  Forums like Stack Overflow are filled with an abundance of questions that remain unanswered.  It is safe to assume that those who are best-able to answer any given question are busy.  Thus, for one to distinguish his or her own question among others, the question must be written in a way that deserves to be considered, given time to, or viewed upon at all. 

## ‘Smart Questions’

People are generally more inclined to help those who help themselves—or at least try to.  If a question brazenly displays a lack of effort in self-sufficient resolution, it may receive negative or unhelpful responses in place of desirable ones.  People are also more likely to respond to questions that are intelligible.
