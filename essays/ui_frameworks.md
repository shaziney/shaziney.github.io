## Getting Started \[and Baffled\] with HTML and CSS

Learning a new programming language can be complicated frustrating. In the case of using HTML and CSS to create a web-page, one may find his or herself particularly frustrated due to a lack of skills in visual design.  However, the skills needed to use HTML and CSS are not simply limited to visual design.  It is also the art of manipulating the raw syntax of HTML and CSS to manually create each and every design element and put them together in an aesthetically appealing way.  Whether or not a person has these skills, using them to achieve the creation of clean and uniform web-pages can take a lot of time.  For anyone who falls in either category or shares these feelings, there is a solution, and that is to use a front-end development framework.

## Front-end Development Frameworks

*Front-end* as opposed to *back-end* refers to what one can see and actually interact with, so web development falls within this category.  A *framework* is a standardized set of concepts or solutions to certain problems.  In terms of web-design, a framework is a structured package of files, which includes codes that address or handle commonly needed implementations or formats.

## Easy-mode with Semantic UI

The most popular front-end development framework to date is [*Bootstrap*](http://getbootstrap.com/), which was developed by Twitter.  Second to Bootstrap is [*Semantic UI*](http://semantic-ui.com/).  Those beginning to use HTML and CSS may find Semantic UI appealing because is uses a natural language, which makes it easy to use.  

For example, instead of trying to figure out how many pixels wide an image should be set to, class names, which include *big* or *small*, can be used to set an image to a general size.  In Semantic UI, these classes for sizes are predefined as shown in the table.

```html
<img src="image.gif" style="width:128px;height:128px;">
```

```html
<img class="ui mini image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui tiny image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui small image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui medium image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui large image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui big image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui huge image" src="/images/image.png">
<img class="ui massive image" src="/images/image.png">
```

While Semantic UI may be a great framework to use to make web design easy, it also has its own limitations.
